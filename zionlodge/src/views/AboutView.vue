            John and I (Susan), have been married for 28 years and we share a very special love found in Jesus Christ.  We have 2 grown children, Rachel and Daniël.  <br/><br/>
            
            We discovered this rare gem in 2011 after following God’s call into a new season in our lives.   It was love at first sight and all 4 of us were convinced that this would be our new address. 
            After purchasing the land, the previous owners told us that Tannie Oufie (a radical prayer warrior at the turn of the century) poured oil from the wood frameworks of the thatch roofs while they were being built, to anoint this property for God’s purposes. <br/><br/> 
        
            The Van Zyl’s new song started in June 2011 when we moved to Zion Garden & Game Lodge. <br/><br/>

            Our first passion is to LOVE God and we love putting Him in the centre of everything we do. John has a passion for veterinary science and gardening while my passion is for God’s beautiful people.  To me a stranger is merely another person to befriend.   
            Rachel is a qualified chef and baker while Daniël is a passionate servant, braaier and meat smoker. <br/><br/>
            
            Our family is blessed to be a blessing while sharing love and hospitality, making our guests feel touched and spoiled, demonstrating our Father’s heart of LOVE. <br/><br/>

            <span class="font-[1000]">There is just something about Zion!<br/><br/></span>

            Something about setting your feet on this piece of land… Something about strolling in the garden and bush… Something about lying under the star filled sky… Something about sitting around the fire at night… 
            Something about sharing a meal around one of the tables… Something about the air you breathe… even something about the water you drink… <br/><br/>
        
            We get asked this question so often: what is this something?<br/><br/>

            And our heartfelt response is without any doubt that it is GOD’s PRESENCE! We pray that you will encounter Him – His love, His grace, His JOY, His peace, His faithfulness and His REST… <br/><br/>

            Zion is our family's home and we feel so priveledged to share our home and small piece of the Waterberg with you, making you feel right back in the Garden of Eden with God. <br/><br/>
